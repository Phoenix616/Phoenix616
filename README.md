### Hi! 👋

I am a 27 year old software engineer from Germany.

I am creating lots of different open source stuff out of pizza and beer, mostly in Java and for Minecraft but I have some other random projects as well, just check out [my repos](https://github.com/Phoenix616?tab=repositories)! :)

Most of the projects are done for my own (completely free) survival Minecraft server [Minebench.de](https://s.moep.tv/minebench). (Lots of its code can be found [here](https://github.com/Minebench) and is open source too!) I have also written a good amount of Minecraft related libraries like [InventoryGui](https://github.com/Phoenix616/InventoryGui) and [MineDown](https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown) and am currently also maintaining [ChestShop 3](https://github.com/ChestShop-authors/ChestShop-3) and [TravelPortals](https://github.com/cppchriscpp/TravelPortals). And I contributed to Bukkit, Spigot and Paper too! (See my own Paper fork [Origami](https://github.com/Minebench/Origami/) for even more experimental patches!)

Hours invested into different projects and tasks:

I also stream on [Twitch.tv](https://s.moep.tv/tmtwitch), normally it's gaming but you might catch me coding on Minecraft stuff as well! I usually just stream in my native language German but I have spoken English for more than half of my live so just ask and hang out!
