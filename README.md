### Hi! üëã

My name is Max, I am a German software engineer and fan of open source, crypto currencies and llamas.

I am creating lots of different open source stuff out of pizza and beer, mostly in Java and for Minecraft but I have some other random projects as well, just check out [my repos](https://github.com/Phoenix616?tab=repositories)! üòä

Most of the projects are done for my own (completely free) survival Minecraft server [Minebench.de](https://minebench.phoenix616.dev). (Lots of its code can be found [here](https://github.com/Minebench) and is open source too!) I have also written a good amount of Minecraft related libraries like [InventoryGui](https://github.com/Phoenix616/InventoryGui), [MineDown](https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown) and [lang](https://github.com/Phoenix616/lang) and am currently maintaining [ChestShop 3](https://github.com/ChestShop-authors/ChestShop-3) and [TravelPortals](https://github.com/cppchriscpp/TravelPortals). On top of all of these projects I contributed to Bukkit, Spigot and Paper too! (See my own Paper fork [Origami](https://github.com/Minebench/Origami/) for even more experimental patches!)

*Hours invested into different projects and tasks:*

I also stream on [Twitch.tv](https://tmtwitch.phoenix616.dev), normally it's gaming but you might catch me coding on Minecraft stuff as well! I usually just stream in my native language German but I have communicated in English for more than half of my life so just ask and hang out!

#### Money ü§ë
Development costs time and almost all my work is open source! If you too believe in the massive value of open source software and want to support me directly then I would highly appreciate that!

If you want to support me then I have setup a [page](https://tip.phoenix616.dev) which shows all the different ways. Options include [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Phoenix616), Paypal, Patreon and various crypto currencies!
