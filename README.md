### Hi! 👋

My name is Max, I am a German software engineer and fan of open source, crypto currencies and everything cyberpunk.

I am creating lots of different open source stuff out of pizza and beer, mostly in Java and for Minecraft but I have some other random projects as well, just check out [my repos](https://github.com/Phoenix616?tab=repositories)! 😊

Most of the projects are done for my own (completely free) survival Minecraft server [Minebench.de](https://s.moep.tv/minebench). (Lots of its code can be found [here](https://github.com/Minebench) and is open source too!) I have also written a good amount of Minecraft related libraries like [InventoryGui](https://github.com/Phoenix616/InventoryGui), [MineDown](https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown) and [lang](https://github.com/Phoenix616/lang) and am currently maintaining [ChestShop 3](https://github.com/ChestShop-authors/ChestShop-3) and [TravelPortals](https://github.com/cppchriscpp/TravelPortals). On top of all of these projects I contributed to Bukkit, Spigot and Paper too! (See my own Paper fork [Origami](https://github.com/Minebench/Origami/) for even more experimental patches!)

*Hours invested into different projects and tasks:*

I also stream on [Twitch.tv](https://s.moep.tv/tmtwitch), normally it's gaming but you might catch me coding on Minecraft stuff as well! I usually just stream in my native language German but I have communicated in English for more than half of my life so just ask and hang out!

Development costs time and almost all my work is open source! If you too believe in the massive value of open source software and want to support me directly then I would highly appreciate that!
